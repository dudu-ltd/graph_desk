- The current repo is used to feed back the issues and requirements of GraphDesk.
- At present, it is personal maintenance.
- I will choose the appropriate time to open source to the current REPO.
- This is the public beta stage. There will be many problems and imperfections. Please be more tolerant.

    - If it bothers you, [issue](https://github.com/dudu-ltd/graph_desk/issues/new) please.
    - If you want to contribute ideas, [discussion](https://github.com/dudu-ltd/graph_desk/discussions/new?category=ideas) please.
- If my personal savings can allow me to develop full-time, I will continue to improve the current client.
